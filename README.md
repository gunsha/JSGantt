# Changes so far
## Added support for multiple languages via jsgantt.lang.js
 just add your language on the file
 
 var vLang = {
		"es":{
			time : {hour:"Hora",hours:"Horas",minute:"Minuto",minutes:"Minutos",day:"Día",days:"Días"},
			months : new Array("Enero","Febrero","Marzo","Abril","Mayo","Junio","Julio","Agosto","Septiembre","Octubre","Noviembre","Diciembre"),
			tableHead : {resource:"Recurso",duration:"Duración",comp:"% Comp.",sDate:"Fecha Inicio",eDate:"Fecha Fin"}
		},
		"en":{
			time : {hour:"Hour",hours:"Hours",minute:"Minute",minutes:"Minutes",day:"Day",days:"Days"},
			months : new Array("January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August","September","October","November","December"),
			tableHead : {resource:"Resource",duration:"Duration",comp:"% Comp.",sDate:"Start Date",eDate:"End Date"}
		}
	};
by default it starts in English, to change simply add the language variable at the end of the initialization of the chart
	
	var g = new JSGantt.GanttChart('g',document.getElementById('GanttChartDIV'), 'day','es');	
	

## Added support for parsing JSON tasks using parseJSON()

structure of JSON task

{
	pID = 0,
	pName = "",
	pStart = "",
	pEnd = "",
	pColor = '0000ff',
	pLink = "",
	pMile = 0,
	pRes = "";,
	pComp = 0;,
	pGroup = 0;,
	pParent = 0;,
	pOpen = 1,
	pDepend = "";,
	pCaption = "",
	pActionLink = 0
}
